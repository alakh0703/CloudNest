        <h3 className="cloud-infra-subheading">Understanding Cloud Infrastructure:</h3>
        <p className="cloud-infra-paragraph">
          Cloud infrastructure refers to the underlying hardware and software components that power cloud computing services. It encompasses
          a vast network of data centers, servers, storage devices, networking equipment, and virtualization software that work together to
          deliver on-demand computing resources over the internet. Key elements of cloud infrastructure include:
        </p>
        
        <ul className="cloud-infra-list">
          <li className="cloud-infra-list-item"><strong>Data Centers:</strong> These are the physical facilities that house servers and storage devices. Data centers are strategically located worldwide to ensure data redundancy, low latency, and high availability.</li>
          <li className="cloud-infra-list-item"><strong>Virtualization:</strong> Virtualization technology enables the creation of virtual machines (VMs) and virtual networks, allowing for efficient resource allocation and management.</li>
          <li className="cloud-infra-list-item"><strong>Networking:</strong> High-speed, redundant networks connect data centers, ensuring seamless data transfer and communication between cloud services.</li>
          <li className="cloud-infra-list-item"><strong>Storage:</strong> Cloud infrastructure offers scalable and distributed storage solutions, accommodating vast amounts of data and ensuring data resilience.</li>
          <li className="cloud-infra-list-item"><strong>Security:</strong> Robust security measures, including encryption, access controls, and threat detection, safeguard data and resources within the cloud.</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h3 className="cloud-infra-subheading">Advantages of Cloud Infrastructure:</h3>
        <ul className="cloud-infra-list">
          <li className="cloud-infra-list-item"><strong>Scalability:</strong> Cloud infrastructure allows organizations to scale computing resources up or down based on demand, eliminating the need for costly upfront investments in hardware.</li>
          <li className="cloud-infra-list-item"><strong>Flexibility:</strong> Businesses can choose from a variety of cloud service models, including Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS), Platform as a Service (PaaS), and Software as a Service (SaaS), tailoring their IT environment to specific needs.</li>
          <li className="cloud-infra-list-item"><strong>Cost Efficiency:</strong> Pay-as-you-go pricing models enable cost savings by only paying for the resources used, reducing capital expenditures.</li>
          <li className="cloud-infra-list-item"><strong>Global Reach:</strong> Cloud infrastructure providers have a global presence, making it easy for organizations to expand their operations to new regions without building physical data centers.</li>
          <li className="cloud-infra-list-item"><strong>Resilience and Reliability:</strong> Redundant data centers and backup systems ensure high availability and data recovery capabilities, minimizing downtime and data loss.</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h3 className="cloud-infra-subheading">Use Cases of Cloud Infrastructure:</h3>
        <ul className="cloud-infra-list">
          <li className="cloud-infra-list-item"><strong>Application Hosting:</strong> Cloud infrastructure hosts applications, enabling users to access them from anywhere, on any device.</li>
          <li className="cloud-infra-list-item"><strong>Big Data and Analytics:</strong> Cloud platforms provide the computational power and storage needed for analyzing vast datasets, driving data-driven insights.</li>
          <li className="cloud-infra-list-item"><strong>IoT and Edge Computing:</strong> Cloud infrastructure supports IoT devices and edge computing, enabling real-time processing and decision-making at the network edge.</li>
