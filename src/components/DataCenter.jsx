          <h4 className="data-center-subsubheading">Key Features and Benefits of Micro Data Centers:</h4>
          <ul className="data-center-list">
            <li className="data-center-list-item"><strong>Proximity to End-Users:</strong> MDCs are strategically placed in close proximity to end-users, enabling faster data processing and real-time responses for applications like IoT devices and content delivery.</li>
            <li className="data-center-list-item"><strong>Scalability:</strong> These compact data centers can be easily scaled up or down to meet evolving workload demands, making them highly adaptable to changing business needs.</li>
            <li className="data-center-list-item"><strong>Reliability:</strong> MDCs are often equipped with redundancy features and backup systems to ensure high availability, even in challenging environments.</li>
            <li className="data-center-list-item"><strong>Cost Efficiency:</strong> By reducing data transfer costs and optimizing resource utilization, MDCs can lead to cost savings in the long run.</li>
            <li className="data-center-list-item"><strong>Security:</strong> Enhanced physical security measures can be implemented at MDC sites to protect sensitive data and equipment.</li>

          <h4 className="data-center-subsubheading">Key Features and Benefits of Edge Data Centers:</h4>
          <ul className="data-center-list">
            <li className="data-center-list-item"><strong>Low Latency:</strong> EDCs provide low-latency access to data, making them ideal for applications like autonomous vehicles, online gaming, and telemedicine.</li>
            <li className="data-center-list-item"><strong>Data Offloading:</strong> By processing data locally at the edge, EDCs reduce the burden on centralized data centers and the network backbone.</li>
            <li className="data-center-list-item"><strong>Content Delivery:</strong> EDCs enhance content delivery networks (CDNs) by caching frequently accessed content closer to end-users, improving website and application performance.</li>
            <li className="data-center-list-item"><strong>Compliance:</strong> Some industries with strict data sovereignty and privacy regulations can benefit from EDCs that keep data within specific geographic regions.</li>
            <li className="data-center-list-item"><strong>Resilience:</strong> EDCs often incorporate redundancy and failover mechanisms to maintain high availability.</li>
